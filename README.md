## Sitemap generation (automatic)

This project includes a build-time sitemap generator that collects static pages and dynamic slugs from Supabase (news, wiki, changelogs, events, recent forum threads) and writes `public/sitemap.xml` before builds.

- Run locally: `npm run generate:sitemap` (reads `.env` or process env for `SITE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).
- Build step: `npm run build` runs the sitemap generator automatically via `prebuild`.
- GitHub Actions: There's a workflow `.github/workflows/generate-sitemap.yml` that runs on push to `main` and commits updated `public/sitemap.xml` back to the repo when it changes.

Add the following env vars in your deployment platform for accurate dynamic sitemaps:

- `SITE_URL` — e.g., `https://z-craft.xyz`
- `SUPABASE_URL` — your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — **optional but recommended** for reading protected tables
- `SITEMAP_FORUM_LIMIT` — optional limit for number of forum threads (default 500)

A `.env.example` file is included at the repo root to help set these values.
